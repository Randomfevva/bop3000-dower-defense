# BOP3000-Tower-Defense

## Overview

BOP3000-Tower-Defense is a web-based Tower Defense game developed using HTML Canvas, JavaScript, and CSS as part of a Bachelor's thesis project. The game is designed to explore real-time rendering techniques, game mechanics, and performance optimization within a browser-based environment.

## Project Purpose

This project serves as a practical implementation of theoretical concepts related to game development, software architecture, and web technologies. The primary focus is on:

Game mechanics: Implementing enemy waves, tower placement, attack logic, and bullet physics.

Performance optimization: Ensuring smooth rendering and gameplay within the HTML Canvas.

Web-based interaction: Making the game accessible without requiring additional installations.

Scalability: Designing a codebase that allows easy expansion of features.
